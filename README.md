# Smartphone Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview:

This SQL project, "Smartphone_Dataset_Analysis," is designed to delve into various aspects of smartphone data using structured queries. It covers basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of analysis, exploring different attributes of smartphones such as brand, price, specifications, and features. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights into the smartphone market through SQL queries.


## Project Structure:
The project is divided into four levels of analysis: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert. Each level focuses on distinct aspects of smartphone data, providing insights ranging from simple statistics to complex correlations.

## Levels of Analysis:
### Easy Level:
- Step 1 : Retrieve all columns for the first 10 records in the dataset.
- Step 2 : List the unique brand names present in the dataset.
- Step 3 : Find the total number of mobile phones with 5G capability.
- Step 4 : Display the details of mobile phones with NFC support.
- Step 5 : Retrieve mobile phones with IR blaster feature available.
- Step 6 : Calculate the average price of mobile phones, handling null values.
- Step 7 : List the top 5 mobile phone brands with the highest ratings, handling null values.
- Step 8 : Find the number of mobile phones with fast charging available.
### Medium Level:
- Step 1 : Display mobile phones with RAM capacity greater than 6GB, handling null values.
- Step 2 : Identify mobile phones with internal memory greater than 128GB, handling null values.
- Step 3 : Calculate the average screen size of mobile phones, handling null values.
- Step 4 : List the top 3 mobile phones with the highest refresh rate displays, handling null values.
- Step 5 : Find mobile phones with more than 3 rear cameras, handling null values.
- Step 6 : Display mobile phones with multiple front cameras available.
- Step 7 : Retrieve mobile phones running on Android OS, handling null values.
### Hard Level:
- Step 1 : List mobile phones with primary rear cameras of resolution higher than 12MP.
- Step 2 : Identify mobile phones with primary front cameras of resolution higher than 8MP.
- Step 3 : Display mobile phones with extended memory available.
- Step 4 : Retrieve mobile phones with fast charging support up to 50W, handling null values.
- Step 5 : Calculate the average battery capacity of mobile phones, handling null values.
- Step 6 : List mobile phones with processors from Snapdragon, handling null values.
- Step 7 : Display mobile phones with processor speeds greater than 2.0 GHz, handling null values.
## How to Use:
- Step 1 : Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Step 2 : Ensure you have access to an SQL database management system.

- Step 3 : Execute the SQL scripts in your preferred environment.

- Step 4 : Review the results and insights provided by each query.
